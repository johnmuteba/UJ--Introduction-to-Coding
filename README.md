# UJ—Introduction to Coding for Data Science

Welcome to the official repository for the course **INCO9X1: Introduction to Coding for Data Science**, offered at the **University of Johannesburg** as part of the **Master of Financial Engineering (MFE)** program.

## 📘 Course Overview

This course provides MFE students with a strong foundation in Python, R, SQL, and data science techniques, emphasizing real-world applications in financial engineering. Students learn how to manipulate, analyze, and visualize structured and unstructured data, with a particular focus on natural language processing (NLP), machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) for financial decision-making.
